#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) o(n^3-1)


b) o(n^2)


c) o(bunnies) ===> o(n)

## Exercise II

## Using Polya

### get the pivot floor and the number of story 
def(getOptimalFloor(n)):
    value = []
    dropped = number of egg dropped
    for floor in range(0 , n+1): ====> 0(n)
        for in range(floor, n+1): ====> 0(n)
            AllbrokenEggs = sum(BrokenEggs) ===> o(1)
        notBrokenEggs = dropped - AllbrokenEggs =====> o(1)
        difference = notBrokenEggs - AllbrokenEggs
        value.append(difference)
    return value.index(max(value))
    
    
### if the number of eggs dropped minus the number of eggs broken is less than  number of broken eggs, move f above


## for each 


    
### get floorThatBreaksEggs 

### get floorsThatDoesNotBreakEggs
